# IPSec Ansible Role installation

Here are two approaches are presented:

- By using a default `ipsec.conf` with Strongswan installation
- By using a modern-way 'swanctl' with Strongswan installation

More preferable the [**second**](strongswan_swanctl) approach, but you may choose either you want.


Both roles are tested on:
- CentOS7
